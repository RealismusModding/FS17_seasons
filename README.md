# FS17 Seasons (Not yet released, work in progress)

This mod is not complete and is actively being worked on. Nothing is guaranteed to work and the mod is in a state of constant flux.

***WARNING***: We do not officially support activating the Seasons mod on an existing savegame. Do this at your own risk. Read more about this in the [F.A.Q.](https://github.com/RealismusModding/FS17_seasons/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#q-why-do-you-now-support-adding-the-seasons-mod-to-an-existing-savegame)

***WARNING***: This mod is a Work in Progress. That means at any time your savegame might not work anymore. Please do give feedback on [Slack](http://realismus.joskuijpers.nl) and post any issues you find!

## Publishing
Only the Realismus Modding team is allowed to publish any of this code as a mod to any mod site.
The code is open for your own use, but give credit where due.
Thus, when building your own version of Seasons, give a credit notice to Realismus Modding when publishing screenshots or images.
This is not required when using the only official published mod by Realismis Modding, on ModHub. It would be a nice gesture however.

## Making videos
Because this mod is WIP and not yet released we have a couple of rules regarding videos to keep both our and our players experience the best. You are allowed to make videos with Seasons, under a couple of simple conditions:

- Make very clear to your viewers that this mod is a Work In Progress and is not yet released
- You do _not_ need to put the mod name in the video title, but you can if you want.

- Join us on [Slack](http://realismus.joskuijpers.nl) and tell us all about your awesome video.

Videos that are not holding to the rules will get a request for removal.

## Features

### Seasons
- Plowable snow in the winter! Reduced tire friction when driving in snow.

- Changed the weather system to fit the seasons
  - Rainy in autumn
  - Sunny in summer
  - Snow and hail in winter.

- Winter kills certain crops
- Grass is knocked back to stage 2 in the winter
- Crop growth duration is much, much longer: for some crops more than half a year
- Growth is adjust to match real life life as much as possible - for example, crops will not grow if planted at the wrong time of the year
