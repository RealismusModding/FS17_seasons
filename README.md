# FS17 Seasons (Not yet released, work in progress)

This mod is not complete and is actively being worked on. Nothing is guaranteed to work and the mod is in a state of constant flux.

***WARNING***: We do not officially support activating the Seasons mod on an existing savegame. Do this at your own risk. Read more about this in the [F.A.Q.](https://github.com/RealismusModding/FS17_seasons/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#q-why-do-you-now-support-adding-the-seasons-mod-to-an-existing-savegame)

***WARNING***: This mod is a Work in Progress. That means at any time your savegame might not work anymore. Please do give feedback on [Slack](http://realismus.joskuijpers.nl) and post any issues you find!

## Publishing
Only the Realismus Modding team is allowed to publish any of this code as a mod to any mod site.
The code is open for your own use, but give credit where due.
Thus, when building your own version of Seasons, give a credit notice to Realismus Modding when publishing screenshots or images.
This is not required when using the only official published mod by Realismis Modding, on ModHub. It would be a nice gesture however.

## Making videos
Because this mod is WIP and not yet released we have a couple of rules regarding videos to keep both our and our players experience the best. You are allowed to make videos with Seasons, under a couple of simple conditions:
- Do not share the GitHub link.
- Do not explain how to install this mod. (The mod might also change at any moment, making your video outdated)
- Give credit to 'Realismus Modding' as creators of the mod.
- Link to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsuba_zBOv5YBpJZizLD2Ow),
  and link to the FS-UK WIP [topic](http://fs-uk.com/forum/index.php?topic=187664.0).
- Make very clear to your viewers that this mod is a Work In Progress and is not yet released
- You do _not_ need to put the mod name in the video title, but you can if you want.

- Join us on [Slack](http://realismus.joskuijpers.nl) and tell us all about your awesome video.

Videos that are not holding to the rules will get a request for removal.
If you have any questions about this policy you can ask them on Slack.

## Forking the code
You are allowed to fork this repository, apply changes and use those for private use.
You are not allowed to distribute these changes yourself.
Please open a pull request to allow for merging back your adjustments. (See also 'Publishing')

## Pull Requests
Please join us on [Slack](http://realismus.joskuijpers.nl) to discuss any changes you wish to make via pull requests, otherwise they are likely to be rejected, except for translations.

## For map makers
For a better game experience, custom maps should add two new density layers: one snow mask and one salt layer. See [here](https://github.com/RealismusModding/FS17_seasons/wiki/Info-for-Map-Makers) for more information, or join our [Slack](http://realismus.joskuijpers.nl).

## Features

### Seasons
- Changeable season lengths. (For best results, restart the game / server after changing season length)
- Plowable snow in the winter! Reduced tire friction when driving in snow.
- Soil temperature is properly modelled using thermnodynamic equations and historical data, which introduces interesting aspects like soil is frozen in the winter and sometimes in the first few days of spring, so you can't work on it
- Changed the weather system to fit the seasons
  - Rainy in autumn
  - Sunny in summer
  - Snow and hail in winter.
- Winters have longer nights than summers. In the winter it might be light only 8 hours while in summer it is near 17 hours.
- Pedestrians do not spawn in the Winter.
- When snow falls, tippers and shovels fill up. Put them in a shed (when the map has a snow mask) or activate the cover.
- Snow will melt from tippers and shovels when it is not freezing outside.
- Bunker Silo contents now take one third of a season to ferment.

### Weather forecast
- 7 day weather forecast

### Crops
- Vanilla growth is completely disabled. The mod controls all growth of fruits, including pine trees (5 years to fully grown, harvestable after 2 years)
- Winter kills certain crops
- Grass is knocked back to stage 1 in the winter
- Crop growth duration is much, much longer: for some crops more than half a year
- Growth is adjusted to match real life life as much as possible - for example, crops will not grow if planted at the wrong time of the year
- Winter and spring crops are possible now. Some crops can be planted in autumn (barley, wheat and canola) and in spring and will reach harvestable stage by the summer. Some crops can only be planted at certain times of the year.
- Growth is configurable and can be changed by map makers to suit their map
- Germination of planted crops will only occur if the soil temperatures rise above the germination temperature.
- Swaths will reduce over time.
- Grass bales will rot and disappear after two days. 
- Hay and straw bales exposed to rain will start to rot so keep them inside.
- Wrapped bales needs time to ferment before they are turned into silage
- Treshing can only be done when moisture content of the crop is sufficiently low. After rain the crop needs time and sunny weather to dry. Moist summer nights can also occur.
- Missions have been disabled as the in-game growth system on fields not owned by the player was causing undesireable effects
- Custom fruits are handled gracefully by using barley's growth patterns. Map makers can choose to modify the growth patterns of vanilla fruits and also make the mod aware of custom fruits by supplying custom growth patterns for them 
- Plants are only harvestable in the final growth stage

### Maintenance
- Age in maintenance GUI is now days since last repair
- New maintenance algorithm with repair, maintenance and taxes
- Keep your machine clean to lower daily maintenance costs
- Machine not used? Pay less
- You can repair your vehicles at the vehicle workshop (placeable or on the map). It is more expensive at the dealer
- If you don't maintain your vehicle it may break down

### Finance
- Loan cap is set to 30% of your total owned land value with a minimum of 300,000
- The interest has been adjusted to the new year length.

### Helpers
- Wages have been changed to fit the new economy.
- Overtime, before 6AM and after 18AM or in the weekends, pays 150%

### Animals
- Animals have been adjusted to the seasons
  - They drink more water in summer than in winter
  - They need more straw in winter than in summer
  - They only give birth to offspring in spring (pigs and sheep) or summer (cows)
  - Milk and wool production depend on season (Wool only in spring, milk spread, mostly in winter and spring)
- Animals die when they have no food. (Disabled on 'Easy')

### Warnings for gameplay
- Do not fast forward faster than 6000x on singleplayer (preferable even slower)
- Do not fast forward faster than 1200x on multiplayer (120x is even better)
The game will get out of sync with the extra load of Seasons

### Informal explanation
An informal explanation of what this all means (this part is not legalese and can't be treated as such)

Realismus Modding (we) wrote the Mod and we have the copyright on this Mod. That means the code is ours and we can do
with it what we want. It also means you can't just copy our code and use it for your own projects.
Only we can distribute the Mod to others.
We allow you to make small changes for your own gameplay or with your friends. But you are not allowed to
publish these changes openly.
When you make a contribution (translations, code changes) you give that code to us. Otherwise we would
not be able to publish this Mod anymore.
If you lose your savegame or if your computer crashes due to our Mod, you can tell us and we will
attempt to fix the mod but we will not be paying for a new computer nor getting your savegame back.
(Make backups!)
